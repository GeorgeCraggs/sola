# Sola

A prototype front-end compiler/framework build to make progressive enhancement
and accessibility easy.

Work in progress - Not suitable for production use.

Sola is currently missing important features (like composable components), and
any APIs may change frequently.

## Features

- Runs server-side (in the future it will take over client-side when JS is
		available)
- Two-way data binding
- Compiled templates
- Single file components
- Fast / Lightweight

## Requirements

- Deno

## Running Examples

Head to the examples directory and run `./compile-and-run.sh`.
